# Lights Out project

We'd like you to implement a simple version of the '90s game "Lights Out" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)). The requirements are as follows:

1. The game should display a 5x5 grid of tiles that can be in an "on"/"lit" or "off"/"unlit" state.
2. The game should start in a random state (some tiles on, some off).
3. Clicking a tile should toggle the tile + all adjacent tiles.
4. The game should track and display the total number of moves.
5. The game should have a "restart" button which resets the move count to zero and the game to a random state.
6. If the user is able to turn off all of the lights, the game should display a success message with the option to restart the game.

Make sure to include:

1. A README.md that explains how to set up, run the app, and run tests.
2. Tests!
    - JEST
    - REACT TESTING LIBRARY
    - CYPRUS

Very basic example:
